# ARTISTIC-SCRAPYARD Artistic Scrapyard is an e-commerce website that aims to be a platform where people can sell their old or scrap items. From 
this website, an artist can buy those scrap items and customize that scrap items to make useful and decorative items. These creative items can be
 sold on the website itself and other people can buy these items. It helps people to earn by selling their scrap, it helps the artists to buy 
 stuffs on cheap rate and earn money by showing their creativity on it and it will also promote the initiative of #VocalForLocal and make the world
  “a better place” by recycling old items. Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It can also
   prevent the waste of potentially useful materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reducing energy use, air pollution (from 
   incineration) and water pollution. As a fact The World produces 2.12 billion TONS of waste every single year. And making use of the scarp 
   materials by recycling them can save the planet. Now to overcome such issue we have to create awareness among every individual the benefits of
    recycling the materials and understanding the benefits of scrap recycling is important to educate the students about this subject as a learning
     process, by conducting the recycling event activities or special projects.
